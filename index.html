        <h4>NIGHT TRUCKER</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Night Trucker is a retro road racing game in which you must collect boost
          flags in order to increase your speed. Cross the finish line while in
          boost mode to score big points. Avoid collisions with other vehicles to
          survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Insipred by the ZX Spectrum and Atari 2600, this game is written in C++
          and uses the SDL 2.0 library for 2d rendering purposes. It is still a
          WIP, however you can visit my Itch.io page in the meantime for updates.

        <h4>Luxulite Android App</h4>
        <p>
          Luxulite Ltd create vintage inspired costume jewellery and
          accessories. As part of my final MSc Comp Sci project, I designed and
          built an app for the Android platform allowing the user to create a
          customised item for purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was achieved with the Android built-in View component, using
          layered svg vector files to build up a final representation of the
          item being designed. The project was not issued for general release,
          however, given the chance to re-visit the  app I would implement it
          for the browser using a modern js framework  and open up the
          functionality for all. Watch this space...

        <h4>Web Development</h4>
        <p>
          I am currently learning the React framework, actually, some of this page
          is powered by React components.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy all layers of the web stack; during the group project portion
          of my MSc we developed a web app for a fast food outlet. This gave me
          the opportunity to work with tech such as HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript.
          I come from an arts background, and so I like to develop my front-end design
          skills to learn exactly what makes a web app look and feel good for the user.

        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>
          I am a recent (2019) Newcastle University MSc Computer Science gradute.
          I have been programming for many years, starting with ZX Spectrum basic
          before taking the plunge and buying a C++ programming book in around 2006.
          As you can probably tell, game programming was my primary motivation in
          learing to code, however, as time has progressed, I have developed an
          interest across many areas of development, especially the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an undergraduate, I studied guitar making in London, a wonderful
          experience which instilled a deep respect for design which
          I try to apply to my software endeavours whether it be in the form of
          the user interface, or code architecture. I also have mad love for cats.

        <h4>Javascript</h4>
        <p>
          I am fairly new to JS, however I've discovered its a great language to
          experiment with due to its close integration with the browser. I have
          some experience with JQuery and mySQL having used it during my MSc final
          project to handle AJAX requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please check out the links for new experiments in JS as
          and when they appear.
